# Apex Sport Store 
A Term Project of SE234 DevOps Course (Group Name: Cinnamoroll)

## Project Description
The purpose of the project is to provide an actual sports store with the ability to sell their products online. Customers can order from this online store easily, and the shop owner can easily add their products to the store. 
	
When a customer visits this online store in their browser, they can look through the products or narrow results for specific products by choosing a category or directly searching via the search bar. Then, the customer looks for the product images, descriptions, prices, and promotions (if available), and if they want to buy, they can add it to the cart and checkout.
	
We worked on the design to get an energetic and sporty look & feel. The primary and secondary colors of our design are Navy Blue and yellow-orange. The layout is designed to be minimalist and simple and look like a traditional online shop UI so that customers can browse through the storeâ€™s catalog without confusion about the UI.
